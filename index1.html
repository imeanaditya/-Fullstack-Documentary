    They work on layouts, buttons, menus, forms, and animations to make the site attractive and easy to use. 
    Their goal is to ensure the website looks good, loads fast, and works smoothly on all devices.

    to create a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Every click, scroll, or animation you see on a webpage is the 
    result of their work.

    <h2>In Simple Words</h2>

         A Frontend Developer is the creator of the “face” of a website, making it look appealing, run smoothly, 
    and feel easy for users.
